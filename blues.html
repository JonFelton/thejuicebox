        <p>
          Blues is a genre and musical form that originated in African-American communities in the "Deep South" of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in traditional African music, combined with European
          American folk music.Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, and chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads.
        </p>
        <p>
          The origins of the blues are also closely related to the religious music of the Afro-American community, the spirituals. The first appearance of the blues is often dated to after ending of slavery and, later, the development of juke joints. It is
          associated with the newly acquired freedom of the former slaves. Chroniclers began to report about blues music at the dawn of the 20th century.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first publication of blues sheet music was in 1908. Blues has since evolved from unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of slaves into a wide variety of styles and subgenres. Blues subgenres include country blues, such as Delta and
          Piedmont, as well as urban blues styles such as Chicago and West Coast blues. World War II marked the transition from acoustic to electric blues and the progressive opening of blues music to a wider audience, especially white listeners. In the 1960s
          and 1970s, a hybrid form called blues rock evolved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since at least the 1980s, there has been a resurgence of interest in the blues among a certain part of the African-American population, particularly around Jackson, Mississippi and other deep South regions. Contemporary African-American performers
          who work this vein of the blues include Bobby Rush, Denise LaSalle, Sir Charles Jones, Bettye LaVette, Marvin Sease, Peggy Scott-Adams, Mel Waiters, Clarence Carter, Dr. "Feelgood" Potts, O.B. Buchana, Ms. Jody, Shirley Brown, and dozens of others.
