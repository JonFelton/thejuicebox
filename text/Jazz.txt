Origins and Evolution of Jazz

Jazz is a music genre that originated from African American communities of New Orleans in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation.Jazz spans a period of over a hundred years, encompassing a very wide range of music, making it difficult to define.

Jazz makes heavy use of improvisation, polyrhythms, syncopation and the swing note, as well as aspects of European harmony, American popular music, the brass band tradition, and African musical elements such as blue notes and African-American styles such as ragtime.The foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the black experience of the United States, but many different cultures have contributed their own experience to the music as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as "one of America's original art forms".

As jazz spread around the world, it drew on different national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to many distinctive styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s. In the 1930s Kansas City jazz and Gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s and  Cool jazz developed in the end of the 1940s.The 1950s saw the emergence of free jazz and in the mid-1950s, hard bop emerged. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the early 1980s smooth jazz became successful. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.
